# Private Events

We built a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
